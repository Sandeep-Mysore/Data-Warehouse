Data Warehouse Solution for GTD

Domain: Databases

Technologies & Concepts: Design, Modelling, Databases, Docker, Virtual Machine, Ubuntu, MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4J, Studio3D, PhpMyAdmin, CQL (Cypher Query Language), Kaggle, GTD (Global Terrorism Dataset)

The purpose of this project is to implement a data warehouse solution for both SQL and NoSQL databases to reduce query execution time and to compare performances of the databases on the queries.
Created a database using SQL (Structure Query Language) in MySQL.
Created 2 Databases in NoSQL â€“ Mongo DB and Neo4J
Dataset was sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was the Global Terrorism Dataset.
Databases were populated and queries were run simulating real-life scenarios.
A data warehouse was created in the databases to improve query performance, query accuracy, query efficiency and to reduce execution time.
Performances were analysed, evaluated, and compared.
